Scenario: you have data that you need to display on the web. A Postgres database is available to store the data, and you're reasonably comfortable with Python. This tutorial demonstrates how to use PostgreSQL together with the Python web application framework Django to quickly achieve your goal. 

## Steps

1. Create a virtual Python environment
2. Install Django
3. Connect Django to Postgres
4. Define data models
5. Create and run a schema migration
6. Create Django views to present your data

(Please give it a moment to set up - this will go away once we've built a proper base environment)
