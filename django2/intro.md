This tutorial demonstrates how to use PostgreSQL together with the Python web application framework Django. It is an adaptation of Richard Yen's tutorial found at: https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/how-use-postgresql-django

## Expectations
You have data that you need to display on the web. A Postgres database is available to store the data. You have a basic familiarity with Python, basic Linux commands, and with SQL.

## Steps

1. Katacoda's UI and some data to work with
2. Creating a virtual Python environment
3. Installing Django
4. Installing the psycopg Postgres adapter
5. Connecting Django to Postgres
6. Configuring our Django project
7. Creating a Django app
8. Defining data models to represent our data
9. Creating and running a schema migration
10. Creating a Django views to present our data
11. Setting up URL routing for our Django app
12. Run the app!

Prefer to review the code this locally? You can find all the material used in this tutoral on GitHub: (TODO: link)

(Please give the Katacoda environment a minute to set up - this will go away once we've built a proper base environment)
