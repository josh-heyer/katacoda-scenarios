# Django + Postgres Katacoda tutorials

What's interesting about an introduction to Django and Postgres? Creating a model class and **seeing it transformed into tables and constraints**. Then writing filters and query expressions to **retrieve, modify or store relational data without ever touching SQL**. Then using these **database-backed objects to power a website!**

This tutorial...

- ...gets you to those good bits quickly & easily
- ...allows you to break out and play around at any step
- ...provides (via Katacoda) a **live, running system** with the language and database pre-configured
